x = connection_types[conn.type](**conn.details)

x = connection_types[conn.type](config=conn.details)

# depends on what connection_types[conn.type] expects, 
# if it expects individual keyword arguments for host and port, it will be called as connection_types[conn.type](host="example.com", port=5432).
# if it expects config as a dictionary, it will be called as connection_types[conn.type](config={"host": "example.com", "port": 5432}).

# The difference between x = connection_types[conn.type](**conn.details) and x = connection_types[conn.type](config=conn.details) lies in how the conn.details dictionary is passed as arguments to the constructor of the class specified by connection_types[conn.type].
# x = connection_types[conn.type](**conn.details):
# In this line, the double asterisk ** is used to unpack the conn.details dictionary. It means that each key-value pair in the dictionary will be passed as a separate keyword argument to the constructor.
# For example, if conn.details is {"host": "example.com", "port": 5432}, and connection_types[conn.type] expects individual keyword arguments for host and port, it will be called as connection_types[conn.type](host="example.com", port=5432).
# This assumes that the keys in conn.details match the expected argument names in the constructor of the class. If they don't match, you may get a TypeError or a similar error.
# x = connection_types[conn.type](config=conn.details):
# In this line, the conn.details dictionary is passed as a single keyword argument named config to the constructor.
# For example, if connection_types[conn.type] expects a single keyword argument named config and can handle the dictionary as a configuration object, it will be called as connection_types[conn.type](config={"host": "example.com", "port": 5432}).
# This approach is more suitable when the class is designed to accept a configuration dictionary as a whole.
# In summary, the primary difference is in how the dictionary is passed to the constructor. The choice between **conn.details and config=conn.details depends on how the class's constructor is designed and whether it expects individual keyword arguments or a single configuration dictionary.
